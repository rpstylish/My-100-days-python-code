# set 
'''
Sets are unordered collection of data items. They
store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets O. Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. Sets do not contain duplicate items.
'''
s ={2,4,2,6}
print(s)

info = {"carla", 19, False, 5.9, 19}
print(info)
'''
Here we see that the items of set occur in random
order and hence they cannot be accessed using index
numbers. Also sets do not allow duplicate values.
Quick Quiz: Try to create an empty set. Check using
the typeo function whether the type of your variable
is set
'''
robin = set()
print(type(robin))
